# SilverStripe Documentation Examples

This repository contains all the sample code from doc.silverstripe.org in one 
easy to browse repository for people to refer to. It also provides a place for
developers to keep example doc code tested and working.

As code from some documentation overlaps in terms of naming and functionality, 
this repository shrives to have the final product come together in one 
functional application rather than just a repository of disjoint files.

All code listed here is released under the same BSD license as SilverStripe. You 
are free to reuse code here in your own personal and commercial products.
